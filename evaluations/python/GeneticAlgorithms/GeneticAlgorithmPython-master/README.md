Genetic algorithm implementation in Python

The tutorial discussing the code is available here:

The GA.py file holds the implementation of the GA operations such as muration and crossover. The other file gives an example of using the GA.py file.

It is important to note that this project does not implement everything in GA and there are a wide number of variations to be applied. For example, this project uses decimal representation for the chromosome and the binary representations might be preferred for other problems.
