Previously GRE (**Great Reads and Evaluations**). 

## Great Reads
The **"Great Reads"** section of this repository contains articles that I have found to be useful for understanding key concepts about topics of interest to me. These can also serve as a refresher or reference on these topics in the future.

**UPDATE: I am slowly migrating these to the [ISSUES](https://github.com/ngupta23/gre/issues) section with appropriate tags so that they can be searched easily.** Please refer to the issues section for the most uptodate information.


## Evaluations
The **"Evaluation"** section of this reporistory consists of generic code evaluations I have done related to various topics. Many times, this is a compilatation from several sources (some may even come from the Great Reads section). This can be used as a starting point for future analysis when solving specific problems.
